# Lesson 10 Project
This project will assess your knowledge and skills using the various concepts taught within the lesson to create an "about me" page that will be your résumé. This page can then be used within a portfolio site when you apply for jobs.

## Project Prep
1. If necessary, clone the repo to your computer within your course folder.
2. Open the repo within VS Code. You can open this `readme.md` file within VS Code to view the project directions there.
   > *TIP: Right click on the file and choose the `Open Preview` option.*
3. If there are files and folders present other than this `readme.md` file, take some time to familiarize yourself with the files within the repo so you know where they are located. This will help you when asked to use them within the project directions. *You can ignore the `.gitignore` file.*

> Read through all the project directions before you start working on the project so you know what you will be doing and can plan accordingly what elements to use, if classes and ids need to be created, etc.

## HTML Directions
You will create 2 HTML pages for this project, a reflection page and an about me page. If no element is specified, you must decide the most appropriate element to use. For the about me page, the layout and content will be up to you to decide what to add and style.

### Reflection Page

1. Create an HTML document and call it `index.html`.
2. Add all the necessary base elements to structure the document.
3. Add the following metadata:
   1. Page title
   2. Author
   3. Description
   4. Keywords
   5. Character Set
   6. Document language
4. Create a heading at the top with the text `Lesson 10 Project`.
5. Navigation links with a link to the home page, the about me page, and the home page of your practice activities.
   1. If you published your practice activities to GitHub pages, you can open the website from your practice activity repo and grab the URL from the address bar to use as the `href` for the link.
6. A footer with your name, GitHub username, and date.
7. A main element.
8. Save and apply a commit to the file.
6. In the main element:
   1. Create two sections.

   3. Using appropriate elements, answer the following under the reflections heading:
      1. Reflect upon what you learned in this lesson and identify at least three things that were new to you and how you think you may use them in a project? What job or career path most appeals to you?
   4. Using appropriate elements, answer the following under the next steps heading:
      1. Reflecting on what you learned, what property or concept do you feel you need to learn more about or want to explore in more depth? Why do you feel that way? What steps do you feel could help you learn more about it?
7. Save and apply a commit to the file.

### About Me Page
The structure of this page is up to you based upon the information you need to present for your résumé.

1. Create an `about.html` file.

   1. You can get to your profile page by logging into [GitHub](https://www.github.com), clicking on your avatar image in the upper right corner of the site, and selecting `Your Profile` from the drop down menu.
7. Create the necessary sections, heading, paragraphs, lists, etc. needed to add the content of your résumé to the web page.

## Styling Directions
The styling of the web pages will be up to you to decide. As the about me page will be something you can use after the course, the style should reflect your choices. However, you should incorporate the following:

1. A color scheme.
2. Various font families, font styles, font weights.
3. Utilize modern layout methods - e.g., flexbox, grid, etc.
4. Incorporate transformations and transitions.
