          <h2 class="myr">My Reflections</h2>
          <p class="mainp">I will be honest, writing a resume is not entirely new to me as I have done so in the past. I graduated High School and had written a resume after a year in college (not to mention attended classes that had me creating essays). However, what was new to me was playing around with the various tools that help in creating a competent, functional and visually impressive resume. I utilized two animations (as well as an animation-delay property) for both the index.html and the about.html. The two animations function completely different from one another, and both of which provided a unique experience. The typewriter animation was the first one I had done, and I enjoyed looking for the correct type of font as it is recommended to use a monospace font for that type of animation. The most interesting thing to me about that animation was the process of utilizing steps in combination with the ease. I never would have thought that would be how you could go about accomplishing such a result. I also utilized a fade in animation, which fades in while moving downwards, with the headings being revealed first, and the content below the headlines being revealed at a slight delay. These two animations to me provided a means of creating a visually appealing website and resume. It ultimately provided a unique challenge and what I believe to be the best iteration of my resume.</p>

          <h2 class="myn">My Next Steps</h2>
          <p class="mainp">For me I wish to grasp a better understanding of what can or should not be part of a resume. What I mean is like for the animations, they are visually interesting and provide an aesthetic that I never thought I could do. However initially I had wanted to implement an animation delay for all of the properties ascending downwards. Sort of like a text waterfall if you will. However, after thinking on it and implementing a small-scale concept for it, I realized that the content simply took too long to animate and would probably frustrate the casual observer who wants to learn more about me. In short, I want to translate that I am an artist, but I need to practice these concepts and see for myself what sounds good on paper versus the execution. My next steps revolve around experimentation of various design elements and testing the waters for what can be done and what works with my colors, fonts etc.</p>
