              <h2 class="myr">Hitting Reset For A Greener Tomorrow!</h2>
              <p class="mainp" style="text-align: left;">Nerka Media is a business I started in early 2023 with the primary goals being to provide newfound functionality and purpose to electronics which were either unsightly or worn down. Nerka Media strives in recycling these devices, keeping them out of the landfills, rivers, and the air!</p>
              <h3 class="myr">Why A Sockeye Salmon</h3>
              <p class="mainp" style="text-align: left;">Nerka Media derives it's name from the scientific name for a Sockeye Salmon, also known as Oncorhynchus nerka. These salmon are known to swim upstream as part of their reproductive life cycle. Fighting against the flow of the river to pass onto the next generation. My intent with Nerka Media is to follow this philosophy. For right now, my ventures are set on hitting the reset button in the hopes of a greener tomorrow. I wish to pull these devices from the flow of the current and help them pass on to the future, where people of all ages can enjoy them to their heart's content.</p>
              <h3 class="myr">Where I See Nerka Media In The Future</h3>
              <p class="mainp" style="text-align: left;">Eventually, I wish to have Nerka Media evolve to the point of not only providing refurbishment services, but also to expand into being a multimedia and electronic production company. I want Nerka Media to become an organization where I can pursue publishing multimedia works such as music, movies, and video games. I also wish for this venture to enter the realm of electronics production, where I can manufacture my own replacement parts and services for devices which may need them. I wish for the refurbishment part of this business to remain, but eventually, I want to alter our mission statement towards the effort of “Providing entertainment today, tomorrow, and forever”. I see Nerka Media as an opportunity to innovate, to fight the flow and overcome any obstacles which stand in the way. Not only for publishing works, but for researching and implementing methods of helping our planet.</p>
